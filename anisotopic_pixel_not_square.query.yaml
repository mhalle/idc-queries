summary: > 
 Select all segmentations with anisotropic pixel 
 spacing and number of columns unequal to number of rows.

description: >
  First, we select all series that have segmentations with the 
  number of columns not equal to number of rows, and then 
  from that we select series that have PixelSpacing components 
  that are not equal.

  Note that we select segmentations by specifying SOPClassUID 
  in addition to Modality, since some series have SEG as Modality, 
  but are not DICOM Segmentation objects 
  (see https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part04.html#sect_B.5 
  for the list of SOPClassUID values).
