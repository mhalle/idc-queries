  Count number of series and distinct ImagePositionPatient values per series.
  This query can be useful in identifying image series that are not 
  conventional 3d crossectional images. 
  
  The WHERE clause is there to ignore images that are most likely 
  problematic - for example, some series may have ImagePositionPatient 
  missing altogether, which will lead to NULL value in that column 
  for the series.
