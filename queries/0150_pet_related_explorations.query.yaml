title: PET related explorations

description: |
  For LNQ Erik is working on the PET display calculations and 
  wanted to have a robust implementation of SUV calculations. He 
  worked from QIBA algorithms but did not have sample data.
  We used bigquery to search the headers to what kind of data 
  is in IDC. It was fast and efficient to search and we were 
  able to go back and forth between bq and the idc sandbox 
  to see the images and look at the tags. 
  

  This is a practical example that would have been very hard 
  without IDC and it can be a candidate for an example.


queryResultColumns:
  - name: StudyInstanceUID
  - name: Units
  - name: DecayCorrection
  - name: CorrectedImage

  SELECT
    StudyInstanceUID,
    ANY_VALUE(Units) as Units,
    ANY_VALUE(DecayCorrection) as DecayCorrection,
    ANY_VALUE(CorrectedImage) as CorrectedImage
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.idc_v9.dicom_all`
  WHERE 
    UNITS="PROPCNTS"
      AND DecayCorrection="START"
      AND "DECY" IN UNNEST(CorrectedImage)
      AND "ATTN" IN UNNEST(CorrectedImage)
  GROUP BY StudyInstanceUID
