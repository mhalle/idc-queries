title: Select quantitative and qualitative, pivot by measurement type, join by SOPInstanceUID

description: >
  (since there is one instance of each measurement per SR instance, 
  this approach will work for the LIDC collection)

  TODO: demonstrate how to verify that the results are accurate 
  on example instances
